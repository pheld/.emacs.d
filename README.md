# Radamant's emacs configuration

This configuration uses the
[pallet](https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet) package manager for
managing your emacs packages.

It also includes self bootstrapping when pallet does not yet exist.

## How to use this configuration

1. fork this to your own account
2. clone it to your ~/.emacs.d/
3. open emacs
4. if this is your first load, it should tell you that pallet is not
   installed and ask if you want to install it
5. Type "yes" and wait while the magic happens
6. You should eventually see a reloaded emacs with no errors and good
   set of amazing emacs plugins to get you started.
